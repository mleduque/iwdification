/* TRANSLATORS NOTE:

There are three tra files in this directory. This setup.tra file contains only strings used by 
WeiDU for installation. It's in UTF-8 and does not get converted. The other two are for strings that will
actually make it into the game, with game_strings_ee overriding game_strings on EE games. game_strings 
will get converted to UTF-8 only on EE games. Since game_strings_ee will only be used on EE games, it is
in UTF-8 already and will not be converted. 

In addition to this folder, there are another two tra files used only for the new spells and bard songs,
located in iwdification/iwdspells/copyover/tra/en_us/spells_copied.tra and
iwdification/iwdspells/lang/english/dw_iwdspells.tra. The good news is that the largest one, spells_copied.tra,
is automatically generated when we pull resources from IWDEE. While dw_iwdspells.tra is new, it's also
short.

In the main, automatically generated spells_copied.tra, one manual change is required: in string @216, Cause Disease
is an Abjuration, not Necromancy, and its sphere is Necromantic, not Healing. The rest of the file should
already be pulled directly from your language on IWDEE and should not need translation, though you're welcome
to look it over if you wish.
